## Elements Done Well

1. **Responsive Design**: I ensured that the application is responsive across different screen sizes. This demonstrates my proficiency in creating user-friendly interfaces that work well on various devices. I have also ensured that the UI is accordingly to the sketch provided.

2. **State Management**: I utilized Redux for managing the application's state, promoting better organization and scalability. This showcases my proficiency in implementing state management solutions for complex applications.

3. **API Integration**: I successfully integrated the TMDB API to fetch movie data. This highlights my ability to work with external APIs and handle data asynchronously.

## Improvements with 4 More Hours

Given more time, I would focus on the following enhancements:

1. **Unit Tests**: I would increase test coverage by writing more unit tests to ensure the reliability of different components and features.

2. **Error Handling**: I would implement better error handling for API requests and edge cases to provide a smoother user experience in case of failures.

3. **Optimized Requests**: I would explore ways to optimize API requests, such as implementing caching or pagination, to improve performance.

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**: I would spend time polishing the user interface and adding animations to make the application more visually appealing and engaging.
